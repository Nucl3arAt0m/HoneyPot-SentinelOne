# Cybersecurity Home Lab: Detecting Attackers with Azure and Microsoft Sentinel

## Overview
This project demonstrates a cybersecurity home lab to detect real-world cyber attacks using a honeypot virtual machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure, Log Analytics Workspace, and Microsoft Sentinel. The lab captures failed RDP login attempts, parses them with a PowerShell script, and visualizes attacker geolocations on a world map. It is based on Josh Madakorâ€™s YouTube tutorial: Cyber Home Lab from ZERO and Catch Attackers! (2025).

The lab provides hands-on experience with cloud security, SIEM tools, PowerShell scripting, and Kusto Query Language (KQL), making it valuable for aspiring cybersecurity professionals.
